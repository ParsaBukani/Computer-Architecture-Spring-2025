# Computer Architecture

This repository contains all computer assignments developed for the course  
**Computer Architecture (ECE 371)**, offered by the  
**Electrical and Computer Engineering Department,  
University of Tehran – Spring 1403–1404**,  
under the supervision of **Dr. Saeed Safari**.

## Overview

The projects in this course explore fundamental and advanced concepts of computer architecture.  
They cover **memory-based problem solving**, **single-cycle and pipelined RISC-V processors**, and a **stack-based multi-cycle processor**, with a focus on datapath design, control unit implementation, hazard detection, and Verilog simulation.
